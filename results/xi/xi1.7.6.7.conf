## Generally neutral loss fragment will have a smaller impact on sub-scores then non-lossy versions of a fragment.
## But some sub-scores (anything called conservative) consider a fragment observed if n neutral losses for that fragment were observed even  if the basic fragment is not
## This defines how many neutral loss fragments are needed to make a fragment count as observed

### Candidate selection
## Scoring happens in three stages
## alpha candidates are selected and scored
## top n alpha candidates are taken and all matching beta-candidates will be selected and pre-scored
## the top X of these are then fully matched and scored

## we need the run name and scan number for a spectrum
## but mgf-files have that info (if at all) in the TITLE line
## and it is not exactly defined how that is stored
## some mgf-files that we have encountered are already recognized for others
## the following to regular expressions can be defined to read out scan number and run
## if both are supplied these will be first tried before the internal automatic will be used
## the scan number and the raw file need to be in the first capturing group
## Example:
## the mgf contains headers like:
## TITLE= Elution from: -1.0 to -1.0 period:  experiment:  cycles:  precIntensity: -1.0 RawFile: myrawfile FinneganScanNumber: 14846
## then the regular expressions should be defined as
## SCAN_RE: .*FinneganScanNumber:\s*([0-9]*)\s*
## RUN_RE: .*RawFile:\s*(.*)FinneganScanNumber:
##
## xiSEARCH comes with a range of know regular mgf-title formats but there are a lot
## more formats out there. So if you encounter an error that the file is not known try this.

#####################
## how many cpus to use
## values smaller 0 mean that all avaiblable but the mentioned number will be used
## e.g. if the computer has 4 cores and UseCPUs is set to -1 then 3 threads are used for search.
## this is a bit relativated by the buffering, as buffers also use threads to decouple the input and output of the buffer.
## each thread will also have a small buffer between itself and the input and the output queue - but the overal cpu-usage of these should be smallish
UseCPUs:12
